            <p>The Victoria Falls presents a spectacular sight of awe-inspiring beauty and grandeur on the Zambezi
                River, forming a natural border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It was described by the Kololo tribe living
                in the area as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’ – ‘The Smoke that Thunders’ for the immense spray and incredible noise
                caused by the rushing water. Victoria Falls is now also known as the greatest curtain of falling water
                in the world when its width and height are combined.

                Columns of spray can be seen from miles away as, at the height of the rainy season, more than five
                hundred million cubic metres (over 17 billion cubic feet) of water per minute plummet over the edge,
                over a width of nearly two kilometres or over a mile, into a gorge over a hundred metres or 300 feet
